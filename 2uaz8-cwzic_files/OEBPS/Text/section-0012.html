<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre12">T</span><span class="calibre13">WO MONTHS HAD PASSED</span><span class="calibre11"> since Sylphie and I got married. The university entered a new semester, I became a second-year student, and my daily life underwent a dramatic change.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">First, I moved out of the dorm and began commuting from home. I woke up every morning in a big bed inside my own house. If Sylphie was beside me, we shared a good-morning kiss. Her mornings began early, so she woke about the same time as I did for my training.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Once I was up, I’d start my routine by running a circuit around the inside of the city, then practice swinging the stone sword I’d conjured before during my duel with Luke. As usual, I was unable to wrap a battle aura around my body, but that didn’t mean practicing was pointless.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">For some reason, Badigadi often popped in during my practice, bellowing out the obnoxious laugh that was so loud it annoyed the entire neighborhood. I greeted him politely, nonetheless, and he sometimes acted as my sparring partner. Skill-wise, he didn’t match up to the likes of Ruijerd or Ghislaine. In fact, he was weaker than Eris…actually, no. It wasn’t that he didn’t measure up, just that I got the sense he wasn’t using his full strength. Since he had an immortal body, maybe he just didn’t feel like defense was necessary? On the other hand, he’d offer me surprisingly useful advice every so often, so maybe he really </span><span class="calibre10">was</span><span class="calibre11"> quite strong.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">After training, we’d make tracks for my house, where Sylphie would greet us with breakfast. Badigadi would disappear as soon as he ate his portion. The man was truly a mystery to me. I wondered what he was thinking. Some days, it didn’t seem like he was thinking at all.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">On days when Badigadi wasn’t there, Sylphie and I would lovingly feed each other. When breakfast was over, we would head to the university, which was about a thirty-minute walk away. Zanoba remarked that it was a bit inconvenient, but it didn’t feel that far to me. I could cover the ground pretty quick if I ran. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">We would arrive well before class started. Sylphie and I would part ways just before the dormitories, and I’d kill some time here and there before going to check in on Zanoba and Cliff. Cliff had his nose to the grindstone researching curses every morning. He’d claimed a research lab and spent his time in there disassembling magic items, digging through books, and searching for patterns. Eventually, he began work on an original magical instrument of his own design.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I know you mentioned transferring a curse, but I can’t think of any way you’d go about that,” he told me. “But if my own theory is correct, I should be able to design a magical instrument that can negate curses.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">His theory was that magical items and curses functioned much the same. A curse placed on an object produced a magic item, whereas a curse on a person produced a Cursed Child. In other words, if you could do something about the effects of a magic item, then you could do something about a curse. (The fact that he was stuck using language as ambiguous as “something” was proof his research was still in the beginning stages.)</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I have nothing which requires your help right now. This is my research, so please let me handle it. This is a matter of pride for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">He sounded like a child who thought I might be there to nab his toys. It’d be one thing if Nanahoshi were the one offering to help him, but I didn’t really think there was much I could do to assist. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Afternoons brought with them a high likelihood that Elinalise and Cliff would be all over each other, so I refrained from visiting him during that period.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Zanoba often spent his entire day in his own research room. Generally, he’d be trying to decipher the writing we’d discovered in the manor, or affectionately rubbing his cheek against that of the automated doll’s. He’d made no progress so far, but that was to be expected. His passion was undeniable. I was certain he’d eventually crack the case.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Master, please watch Julie. I’ll take care of this.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Apparently, he was terrified that I’d stick my nose in his research. He spoke as if I’d solve the puzzle at a single glance and bring his quest to an end. People were really overestimating my abilities. I didn’t know anything outside my area of expertise.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">On a related note, Zanoba was continuing to make gradual progress on the red wyrm figurine during his breaks from research. Julie sat nearby, making a figurine herself. He’d given her her own desk to work at and she’d been practicing diligently.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Grandmaster, thank you for your instruction.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Now that I couldn’t teach her at night, I was teaching her earth magic in the mornings instead. We were coming up on a year since we’d found her, and her growth was startling, but it was still too soon for us to put our mass-production plans into practice. For now, all I could do was have her focus on practice through steady repetition. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">According to Sylphie, if a child continued practicing the same school of magic while they were young, it would increase their proficiency with it. Therefore, I had her focus on using only earth magic. If Sylphie’s theory was correct, then Julie would soon be an expert in earth magic. We could move onto the next phase once she’d progressed some more. There was no need to rush.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I still went to the cafeteria for lunch. For various reasons, I’d decided to not bring food from home. The seats in the corner of the first floor were for our exclusive use—“our” being Zanoba, Julie, occasionally Badigadi or Cliff and Elinalise, as well as Linia and Pursena. These days, Luke or Sylphie showed up almost daily. They didn’t eat with us, but they would exchange a few words before taking their leave. According to them, it was to give the appearance that Ariel and I were friends.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I didn’t chat much with Luke, but I was getting more lovey-dovey with “Master Fitz,” who was beginning to look more feminine as her hair grew longer. Some people still thought she was a man, and regarded us with strange looks when they saw us being affectionate. Sylphie still didn’t like public displays of affection when she was in her Fitz persona. She got really upset when I touched her butt one time. She didn’t get angry or glare at me; she just looked sad. She told me she wanted me to refrain from being a creep in front of people. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">That was fair, I supposed. Sylphie wasn’t the type to worry about public attention, but she probably didn’t want people to think her husband was some kind of sex-crazed baboon who couldn’t keep it in his pants. I’d behave myself, for her sake.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">After lunch, I’d always head to class. As usual, I was taking Advanced-tier healing and Intermediate-tier detoxification classes. I’d sit beside Pursena, and we’d focus entirely on memorizing information, casting healing spells on each other, and eating meat. On days when I didn’t have a class, I would teach Linia offensive magic.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“You haven’t been touching us lately, mew.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“You still stink of arousal, but I can’t get over how weird it feels that you don’t try to touch us.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">The two of them couldn’t hide their surprise at my good behavior, but I had pledged my fidelity to Sylphie, and I wasn’t going to touch other girls. Pursena would tease me with flirty giggles, but I just ignored her. Linia would sometimes flash her underwear at me, but I tried to avert my eyes. Unfortunately, I couldn’t beat my deeply ingrained instincts, so I knew she was wearing blue today.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">As the afternoon came to an end, I would pay Nanahoshi a visit. She was as crabby as ever. Now that my libido had returned, I could appreciate the petite Japanese build and features that made her stand out amidst the people of this world. My preferences must have changed since my last life, since I didn’t find her gloomy aura that appealing. It did, however, fill me with a sense of nostalgia.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Just so you know, if you lay a hand on me, I’ll go crying to Orsted.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Please don’t do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Hmph.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">She’d say things like that if I stared too much. She knew how terrified I was of Orsted. I had no intention of touching her anyway, so the exchange was basically reaffirmation that we were maintaining our distance.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Nanahoshi always gave off an aura of irritation and impatience. However, we’d burned through her stock of untested magic circles in the past six months. It seemed it was about time for her to move to the next stage.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Once I finished with Nanahoshi, I’d meet back up with Sylphie. Her bodyguard duties continued on the same schedule as before, but since we were newly married, the Princess let her go home for a while once class ended. She did still have to guard the Princess at night, so after eating dinner, doing a bit of cleaning and taking a bath, she’d immediately head back to the school. It seemed like twice the effort. I was putting her through a lot. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Sylphie, however, didn’t seem to feel that way. “I like having a house to come back to.” Or so she said.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Sylphie was on night guard duty two days out of three. That meant she only had one day to rest. Which was quite a bit, considering that she’d had no days off up till now. The fact that she even got the one day off now was all thanks to Elinalise, who’d personally volunteered to guard the Princess instead. I’d never seen them talk, but apparently, they got along quite well. The two of them seemed like oil and water, what with Elinalise’s promiscuity and Ariel’s circumspect nature, but according to Sylphie, Ariel wasn’t all that pure after all. She was just putting on a show.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">On the days Sylphie didn’t have night duty, she and I would stop by the market on our way home to buy three days’ worth of groceries. Most of the food for sale were things with a long shelf life, such as beans, potatoes, and dried meat. I craved rice. If we expanded the distribution routes that Nanahoshi had developed, perhaps we could import rice from the south. An issue for later, at any rate.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Once we got home, it was dinner time. Contrary to her tomboyish appearance, Sylphie was a good cook. She didn’t know all that many recipes, but her cooking reminded me of my childhood. It tasted like the food I’d eaten growing up in Buena Village, which made sense, given that Lilia was the one who taught her.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">She looked so cute with her apron on, bustling about the kitchen. It made me want to take her in my arms from behind. I once tried to help her cook, but she politely turned me down. Apparently, there was something about making food that she didn’t want to share with anyone else, even though it wasn’t like she was a chef or anything. I thought of suggesting that she wear nothing but an apron, but had the feeling she’d turn me down.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">We occasionally had guests when dinnertime rolled around, and by “guests,” I meant the thirteen we had previously invited. Cliff and Elinalise came over relatively often. Zanoba, perhaps showing restraint, rarely ever showed up. Nanahoshi came over about once a month to use our bath. She probably wanted to visit more frequently, but refrained from doing so. Before any of you get the wrong idea, just let me say it right now—I did </span><span class="calibre10">not</span><span class="calibre11"> peek at her while she was bathing. Nanahoshi seemed to be on her guard about the possibility, anyway. She only ever came over when Sylphie was home.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Once dinner was finished and our guests had gone home, we were left to ourselves for some sweet, sweet alone time. As “Master Fitz,” Sylphie behaved with dignity throughout the day, and expected me to exhibit similar restraint and propriety, even though just seeing her from afar made me want to run up to her like an excited puppy. By contrast, she was loving and submissive at night. She’d do whatever I asked. Even when I let myself slip and said something filthy, she’d gladly fulfill my requests.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Compared to the people in the Asura Palace, you’re completely normal,” she told me. Sylphie never asked anything of me. In fact, she was taking a bat to my my calm, rational side when she said, “I want to do whatever you want to do, Rudy.” </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I’d given in to temptation several times, and done just that. But I couldn’t keep treating her like an object. Sure, I loved sex. This was everything I’d ever dreamed about. Still, Sylphie was my wife. Respect—that’s right, I wanted to respect her. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Or so I thought, but when she looked at me with those shimmering eyes and said, “You don’t have to restrain yourself,” it felt stupid to even try. I was a weak man. There were words I wanted to try saying at least once in my life, or have said to me. There were things I wanted to try doing at least once in my life, or have done to me. In the past two months I’d managed to strike half of those off my list. I didn’t pressure Sylphie into anything, though. Anything she wasn’t keen on, we didn’t do. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Even so, I wanted to do something for her. With that thought in mind, I asked, “Hey, Sylphie, is there anything you want me to do for you?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Huh? Okay, well, do you remember what you promised me before?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">As soon as I heard that I prostrated myself. “I’m sorry, I don’t remember.” </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Flustered, Sylphie forced me to look up, saying, “It’s not your fault, it was a year ago. Remember the thing you used? Disturb Magic. I want you to teach me.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“That’s no trouble at all. I’ll teach you every last detail.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Well, I know Advanced-tier healing magic. Rudy, you’re taking classes on that, right? I can teach you too.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">So we spent our time after dinner teaching each other magic. I would teach Sylphie how to use Disturb Magic and she would teach me how to use healing magic without incantations. There was no real purpose to the latter, but she wasn’t satisfied with just me doing the teaching. I wondered why that was. Was she the type who weren’t happy if they weren’t providing their partner with something? Or the type that felt uncomfortable receiving anything from other people?</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">It was true that I couldn’t cast healing magic without incantations, anyway, so I gratefully accepted her instruction. I could keep an eye out for anything else I wanted to learn from her in the meantime. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Um, I don’t think it’s all that different from casting other types of magic without an incantation,” Sylphie said at one point.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I used to think so, too, and yet the fact remained that I couldn’t use healing magic without an incantation. Not even after listening to Sylphie explain how it worked, and trying to put her instructions into practice.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Rudy, is it possible that you don’t understand what it feels like to be on the receiving end of the spell?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Healing magic entailed touching another person’s body and pouring your own mana into them, using your mana to alter the flow of </span><span class="calibre10">their</span><span class="calibre11"> mana and heal their wounds. I was unable to conjure the feeling of having someone else’s mana interfere with mine. Put more simply, it was like pressing your right index finger against your left palm, but only the finger felt anything.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Offensive magic was as easy as breathing to me. This was odd. Maybe it wasn’t just healing magic that I couldn’t cast without an incantation, but all kinds of support magic? Maybe—like with battle auras—it was just something that people who’d been reincarnated here from another world couldn’t master. Or maybe I just didn’t have a knack for healing magic.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I’m kind of relieved, y’know? There are actually things you can’t do,” Sylphie said with her characteristic toothy grin.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Being outshone by someone at anything was a bit vexing, but it had to have been discouraging for Sylphie to think that there was nothing she could beat me at. So I didn’t let it bother me.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Unlike my futile attempts at healing magic, Sylphie mastered the essentials of Disturb Magic in no time. She still needed practice, but I was sure she’d be able to use it in battle eventually. Sylphie really was an exceptional student. I’d taught magic to a number of people—Eris, Ghislaine, Zanoba, Julie, Linia—but I felt like Sylphie was the quickest among them to learn. She might even be a kind of genius herself.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“But this is kind of unfair, isn’t it? A magician can’t do anything if you do this.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Well, one of the Seven Great Powers used a similar technique.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Really? So that’s where it came from. You’re acquainted with one of the Seven Great Powers, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“No, I’m not. Nanahoshi is.” Sylphie would probably worry if I told her one of them had nearly killed me. It was probably safer to keep any mention of Orsted to myself, too. There was no guarantee he wouldn’t come at me for teaching people how to use Disturb Magic. “You probably shouldn’t share this information with anyone else. That goes for Disturb Magic as well. If one of the Seven Great Powers came after us, I wouldn’t be any match for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Got it. It’s a secret,” Sylphie said, nodding earnestly.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">On days when Sylphie was on night duty, I made a concerted effort to do the cleaning and laundry. In general, washing Sylphie’s clothes was my job, including her panties and bras. Of course, as her husband, I refrained from any acts of perversion. I didn’t pocket them or take them to my room to use them to pleasure myself. I took a sniff at most. Sylphie satisfied my young, active libido once every three days.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I also cleaned the house, more or less, though I did a sloppy job of it, according to Sylphie. Back when I was an adventurer, I would clean every inn room I moved into for the first time, but other than that, I was the messy type. Sylphie would clean on her days off, but this manor was too huge for the two of us to keep spotless. I did think cleaning was a necessity, but the house was just way too big. Maybe we needed to hire a maid.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Thinking about a maid reminded me of Lilia, and I wondered if Paul and the others had already reunited with Zenith. It had been three years since Elinalise and her comrades had located my mother. I estimated it would have taken Roxy and Talhand a year or two to cut across the Demon Continent and arrive in Millishion. If memory served me right, they would then have departed for the Begaritt Continent’s Labyrinth City of Rapan, and I didn’t think that would be a whole year’s journey. I’d sent my first letter a year and a half ago. If it arrived as planned, then I should be getting a reply soon. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I should be more patient. Elinalise had assured me there was nothing to worry about, but I still felt anxious. Roxy was on the case, and I trusted her. I should keep calm and wait.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Now that I thought about it, with Buena Village gone, Paul and the others had nowhere to live. Maybe they’d decide to settle down in Millishion, but if they headed this way, we could live together in this house. Now that I thought about it, you could say that me getting married and buying a house </span><span class="calibre10">was</span><span class="calibre11"> for the sake of my family. Of course, that was something I only thought of after the fact, so it was nothing more than a convenient excuse.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">In any case, to think that a former shut-in like me might be looking after my parents! It was kind of moving…though it </span><span class="calibre10">would</span><span class="calibre11"> be difficult to give up the privacy of my two-person love nest with Sylphie.</span></p>
