<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre12">T</span><span class="calibre13">HE INCIDENT HAPPENED</span><span class="calibre11"> a month after the letter arrived. That day I was assisting Nanahoshi with an experiment, but its parameters were a little different from the usual.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“If this one works properly, I can move on to the next step.” Nanahoshi said, presenting me with a magic circle significantly larger than any of her previous ones. It was still just half the width of a tatami mat, though. It had an intricate pattern, densely written across a rare piece of large parchment.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Just to be sure, may I ask what this circle is supposed to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“It’s going to summon a foreign object from another world.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“And there’s no way that’ll cause another teleportation calamity, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">The Displacement had occurred because Nanahoshi was summoned here. Which meant there was no guarantee that a similar incident wouldn’t occur just because she was summoning something small. At least, that was what I thought, but Nanahoshi just shook her head. “It’s safe. Theoretically, at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Just in case, can I ask what that theory is?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Based on our previous experiments, I’ve confirmed that the bigger and more complex the object you try to summon, the more mana is required. In other words, magic in this world obeys the laws of Conservation of Energy. We’ll be summoning something simple and small this time. If we assume that the energy from my summoning was what wiped out the region, then theoretically this circle will, at most, only teleport people within a meter of its range. I honestly don’t think it’s possible, but just in case, I’ve written a safety measure into the circle itself so I can control how much mana it uses.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I see, I see… Okay, no, I had no idea what she was talking about.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Conservation of Energy… uh, what was that again?” And how was that different from the law of Conservation of Mass?</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I’m not well-informed enough to explain it well to the uninitiated, but it basically means mana is responsible for most of the odd things that happen in this world. That spell you use all the time—Stone Cannon, was it? It appears as if you’ve suddenly conjured a rock in mid-air, but actually you’ve just transformed your mana into a rock.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">The law of Conservation of Energy, huh? So that was it. That was why the more mana you poured into the spell, the hotter the flame in fire magic, and the bigger the resulting mass in earth magic.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Also…” Nanahoshi went on to explain the principle behind her circle to me after that, but it was all Greek to me after a point. Something about if you applied the law of such-and-such, the size and effect of the circle would be this and that, then if you applied this other law of whatever-she-called-it, then blah-blah-blah. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Honestly, if there even was a flaw in her theory, I wasn’t going to catch it. The only thing I did know was that she seemed confident, and that meant there was a high chance of success. Well, even if the worst happened and I got teleported somewhere, I was sure I’d find by way back home somehow. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“If this fails and I get teleported, please contact my family.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I’m telling you, there’s no possibility of that happening.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I stepped up in front of the circle. “Well then, let’s begin.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Please.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I wasn’t sure if that word was directed at me or not. Perhaps it was more of a plea to God.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I began pouring my mana into the circle, placing my hands on the edge of the paper. A current rippled through the circle and it began emitting a glow. I could feel my mana being sucked right out through my arms. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">But it was strange. Something didn’t feel right. It seemed like the path the light was traveling on was obstructed. As if one part wasn’t lighting up.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre10">Pssht!</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">There was a soft zap and suddenly the mana stopped flowing. The light emitted by the circle faded.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">It was over. There was no further reaction from the circle. I looked at it closely and found a tear on part of the paper. Maybe it had short-circuited and the safety kicked in? Regardless, this was a failure.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Well?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“It failed,” said Nanahoshi quietly. She fell back into her chair with a thud, planted an elbow on her desk and let out a big sigh. “Haah.” </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">She stared at the paper still sitting on the floor. The paint had disappeared, leaving only the underlying rough sketch of the circle, and the tear caused by the experiment. Nanahoshi continued to look at it absentmindedly, not moving a muscle. Then after a while she said, without looking at me, “Thank you for your assistance. You can go home today.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">The result of almost two years’ worth of effort had come to nothing in a mere few seconds. “Well, these things happen, you know,” I tried.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Nanahoshi did not reply.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Was it my fault? No, all I did was provide the mana. I didn’t touch anything else. Anyone could’ve done what I did as long as they had the mana for it. So even if the experiment failed because of me, it would be Nanahoshi’s fault for not briefing me enough.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Nanahoshi said nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">At any rate, this was probably it for the day. “Well, excuse me, then.” I stood up to leave. Before I left the experiment room, I turned back to look. She was still in the same position she had been, immobile.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I passed through the messy research room, which looked more like a disorganized warehouse at this point, and stepped out into the hall. I made it just a few steps before I came to a halt. Nanahoshi had been incredibly tense over the past few months. Judging by the way she’d slumped in her chair, she was pretty rattled, Perhaps she wasn’t thinking about her next experiment or the failure at all, but just giving up entirely?</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Nah. Despite what her looks might lead you to believe, Nanahoshi was tough. Surely, she had the capacity to take a failure for what it was and not linger on it.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Just as I thought that…</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“AAAAAAAAH!”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Screams erupted from the research room. Then the sound of something breaking. I spun on my heel and high-tailed it back into the room.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Aaaah!”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Nanahoshi was banging her head up and down in a frenzy. She tore out pages from a book she’d written in and scattered them across the floor. She knocked over some shelves and spilled the contents of a jar. She ripped off her mask and slapped it against the ground. Then she started tearing at her face and stumbled, slamming into a wall. She punched it, then tripped again on the spilled contents of the jar and finally collapsed onto the floor, where she grabbed fistfuls of sand that had spilled out of the jar and hurled them at the ground. Then she stood and started tearing at her hair instead.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Panicked, I rushed over to her and pinned her arms behind her back. “Hold on, calm down!”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I can’t go home, I can’t go home, I can’t go home.” Nanahoshi’s eyes looked vacant as she mumbled those words. All of the muscles in her body went tense, as if she were preparing to go berserk again. “I can’t go home, I can’t go home, I can’t—aaaaaaah!”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">She went into a writhing frenzy, fighting as hard as she could to break out of my grip. But her strength was only that of a high-school girl, and a shut-in at that. Extremely weak. There was no way she could tear herself away. Before long, her body went limp. When I released her, she just weakly sank to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Hey, are you okay?” I got a distinct sense that she was very much not. She was white as a sheet, with vacant eyes and dark circles. Her lips had lost all color and were dry and cracked. This was the face of someone who was in a very bad state, mentally. She might just hurt herself.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I couldn’t leave her alone like this. What should I do? The person who could help most in a situation like this was…Sylphie! That’s right, Sylphie. She might be able to do something about this. And fortituously, she had no night duty today. </span><span class="calibre10">Okay. I’m going to take Nanahoshi back to our place for tonight, then</span><span class="calibre11">.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Wait…before that, I should probably find somewhere for her to calm down. “Are you okay?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“…”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“You overdid it a bit. Let’s rest for today, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Nanahoshi didn’t respond.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I put my arm around her shoulder and practically dragged her to her feet. Then I hauled her out of the research room.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre10">Maybe we should lock it.</span><span class="calibre11"> I paused to consider. </span><span class="calibre10">Nah, we’ll worry about that later. It should be fine for one day. Probably.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I guided us toward the fifth-year classrooms where Sylphie should be. Should I ask someone to get her for me? Or should I go into the class and get her myself? People stared as we passed, Nanahoshi leaning on me for support. This was annoying. We were so conspicuous right now, and Nanahoshi didn’t have her mask on. It was probably best to keep a low profile. But how?</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Master!”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Someone called out to me. I turned to find Zanoba behind me. “Master, what’s happened?!”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Zanoba, Nanahoshi’s in trouble. Help me.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Is she sick?!”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Something like that,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“In that case, we should go to the medical office first.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Oh. Okay, yes. The medical office, then.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I’ll carry her,” Zanoba volunteered.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Be gentle.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Of course. Come then, Master Silent.” </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">He lifted her up princess-style. A solid, stable way of carrying a person. Nanahoshi didn’t resist at all. She had a weary look on her face, like a husk drained of all energy. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Make way!” Zanoba shouted and plunged into the crowd of people. They split like an ocean before him. I followed behind.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">In the infirmary, we let Nanahoshi rest on one of the beds. Her face was vacant. What a terrible expression. It almost looked as if the shadow of death were upon her. We informed the resident healer that it was nothing serious. Psychological problems couldn’t be solved by healing magic, after all.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Just as my gaze began to drift to my feet, Julie grabbed the hem of my shirt. “Grandmaster, your face…it looks awful.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I instinctively touched my face. </span><span class="calibre10">Just what kind of expression do I have right now?</span><span class="calibre11"> </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Oh no. It seemed I was pretty shaken myself. I needed to calm down a little. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“That’s just ’cause I’m no beauty.” I patted her on the head. I couldn’t believe I’d made such a young girl worry over me.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Here, Master.” A cup was suddenly thrust at me from the side. Zanoba was the one holding it.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Thanks.” I took it gratefully and drained its contents. He’d apparently gotten the water from one of the medical office’s pitchers. My tongue felt dry as paper. Apparently, my mouth had gotten really parched at some point.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Phew.” I took a seat and breathed a sigh.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Zanoba stood beside me and quietly asked, “Master, what happened? I’ve never seen you so flustered before.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Well…” I explained what had happened in the experiment room. That the experiment had failed and Nanahoshi went berserk. That she looked like she might kill herself if I left her alone, so I helped her.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">After hearing all of that, Zanoba looked down at Nanahoshi with a complicated expression on his face. “So she’s not conducting this research because she wants to.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Nope.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">It wasn’t like she did it begrudgingly, but she wasn’t exactly passionate about it, either. It was just something she had to do so she could go home. It had been six years since the Displacement Incident, and what she’d thought would be an important step forward had failed. She’d looked back and realized that six years had already passed and she hadn’t progressed at all.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I sighed and slumped back in my chair. Zanoba said nothing more after that. The two of us just remained there with Nanahoshi, who was staring absently at the ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p__star__star__star__page_break"><span><span class="calibre11">***</span></span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"> </p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">After a while, Nanahoshi closed her eyes and fell asleep. Sylphie arrived around the same time. Ariel wasn’t with her. “People were saying that you and Zanoba carried a female student to the medical office,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">What kind of rumors were they spreading now? Did the whole school think I’d knocked out a female student and carried her off to the medical office, where I was probably doing something awful to her?</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre10">Man, that’s cold,</span><span class="calibre11"> I thought. </span><span class="calibre10">Why doesn’t anyone trust me? Because I’m “the Boss”?</span><span class="calibre11"> Well, it was not like I’d done much to earn their trust in the first place. Whatever. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I told Sylphie what had transpired.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I can’t believe something like that happened.” Sylphie wore a solemn expression as she peered over at Nanahoshi.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“It might be dangerous to leave her alone, so I was thinking of letting her rest at our house today.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“But wouldn’t it be better to let her rest here in the medical office?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I think it’d be better for her to be with someone she knows when she wakes up.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">At any rate, I couldn’t leave her alone. Nanahoshi was young and this had clearly shaken her to the core. When people were pushed to their limits, they could do extreme things. Things like hurting themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I have no idea how long it will take for her to calm down,” I said. “I’d like to let her stay with us so I can keep an eye on her for now.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Um, is it okay if I leave that part up to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“If it’s just taking care of her meals, I can do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">We’d isolate her until she calmed down. It might be good to let her escape from reality a bit. A tactical retreat of sorts. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“This isn’t cheating on you or anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I know. Or is there something for you to feel guilty about?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Nope.” I had no reason to feel guilty whatsoever. Still, I was bringing a different woman into my house. One in a weak and defenseless position, at that. Even so, Sylphie didn’t seem to be suspicious. So this was what trust was like, huh? </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I’ll leave it to you, Rudy. Are you going to go straight home today?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Yeah. I won’t be able to go with you, so can you handle shopping on your own?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Leave it to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I nodded at Sylphie’s reassuring response. I’d expect nothing less from her.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">We left the school and hurried back to our house. Zanoba volunteered to transport Nanahoshi. This time he carried her piggyback, which seemed to suit him better, even if he was a prince.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Sorry for the trouble, Zanoba.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“No, this is the only thing I can do to help.” He easily carted the listless Nanahoshi around on his back. Julie toddled along behind us. All I had to do was give Zanoba a drill and a diving suit and people would be calling him Mister Bubbles.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Just to test this out, I tried lifting Julie.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Eek! Grandmaster, what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Zanoba just glanced over. I kept Julie in my arms as I walked. Her body was surprisingly plump. Just a year ago she’d been all skin and bones, but it seemed she’d been eating properly. Her muscles were a bit lacking, but she didn’t really need to be a beefcake at the age of seven. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Is Zanoba treating you well, Julie?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Yes, Master feeds to me lots of food.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Good to hear. The correct way to say it is ‘Yes, Master feeds me lots of food.’”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Master feeds me lots of food.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Yeah, that’s it.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Come to think of it, I wondered if Nanahoshi had been eating properly. She’d felt pretty light when I carried her. Food could lift your spirits in a rough time; even little things like eating your favorite foods or sharing a meal with someone could bring joy. I doubted Nanahoshi had been doing much of that.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Phew,” I sighed. Just what kind of life had Nanahoshi been living? Locked up all by herself, hardly eating, scarcely talking to anyone. Just continuously drawing those magic circles.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“It’s not your fault, Master. Try not to let it affect you so deeply.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Yeah, I know.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Apparently Zanoba had taken my sigh to mean something different. He had a serious expression plastered on his face as he looked at me. It seemed he was more worried about me than he was about Nanahoshi. Well, he’d barely ever talked to her, so I couldn’t blame him for that.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">We fell silent for a while after that. In the quiet, I could hear Julie’s heartbeat. As a child, her body temperature was higher than mine. She was warm, and hearing her heartbeat was also strangely soothing. I should buy her something next time I went out.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">When we reached the house, I had Zanoba deposit Nanahoshi into one of the two rooms I’d spruced up for my little sisters. She just slumped limply upon the bed. Her eyes were open; she must’ve woken up at some point. But they were completely empty. As if she were staring off into a distance I couldn’t see. Almost like a corpse.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Would she be coming back from this? Based on my own observations, she was in a precarious state, but not beyond saving. I’d had similar depressive spells myself before, but they’d passed eventually.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">For the moment, I patted her down and removed anything I thought could be used as a dangerous weapon. She had a small Swiss Army-style knife on her person. I didn’t think she could kill herself with something like that, but I took it anyway, just to be safe.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">There was nothing dangerous in her room except for the window, since we were on the second floor. Maybe I should use magic to secure it. It wouldn’t help if she broke the glass, but I wanted to believe she didn’t have the willpower to go that far.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Since she wasn’t moving, I went back down to the first floor.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Is she going to be all right?” Zanoba asked worriedly. He didn’t seem like the kind of person who’d had any experience with depression. He had his moments of weakness, sure, but he was generally an optimist.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Who can say? At any rate, you were a big help, Zanoba.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“No, you’re the one always taking care of me, after all. This was the least I could do.” That was Zanoba for you. I could always count on him. “What about you, Master? Are you going be all right?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Me? Why?”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“It looks like Master Silent’s breakdown had a severe impact on you.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Severe impact? Really? </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Actually, he was probably right. Nanahoshi had lost it, gone berserk, and then turned into a lifeless shell once I stopped her. Seeing that from beginning to end reminded me of my past. Though it had manifested a bit differently for her, we’d both been through similar mental agonies. I felt her pain as if it were my own. If my circumstances had been a bit different, I might have been the one lying vacantly on the floor in her place.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Just a bit. Reminds me of pain from the past.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Would you mind sharing more?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“When I was little, I also had a similar experience. I became apathetic and shut myself off.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“I can’t understand that feeling.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Although the way he said that felt distancing, I didn’t want him to flippantly claim to understand, either. “I’m sure you can’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Regardless, if there is anything else that could use my strength, please let me know. Strength is the only thing I have in abundance.”</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">“Yeah, I’ll be sure to do that.” I appreciated Zanoba’s kindness. He was a pretty good guy, as long as dolls weren’t involved.</span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">Zanoba went home a short while after that. With nothing else to do, I just spent my time reading in Nanahoshi’s room as she slept. I would want to be left alone if I were in her position. But she’d already been alone up until this point. Always alone. </span></p>
<p class="p_prose_formatting"><span class="calibre11">I stayed with her until Sylphie got home.</span></p>
